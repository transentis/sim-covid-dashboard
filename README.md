This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Here are the steps to follow to create your BPTK Dashboard Widgets Showcase:

1. (optional) Create a virtual environment

2. Install npm (sudo npm install -g npm) and Yarn(“sudo npm install --global yarn”)

3. Clone the repository inside your environment

    git clone https://yournamehere@bitbucket.org/transentis/bptk-widgets-showcase.git

4. Change directory: cd bptk-widgets-showcase

5. Run these two commands in that directory: “yarn install && yarn dev” (alternatively: "npm install && npm run dev "

6. Add a new file in the root folder called .env.local and add the Environment Variabel Called NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL with your backend url

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You are now ready to explore the widgets in our library and understand how they are connected to the simulation server.
