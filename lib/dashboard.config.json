In this case, the pandemic spreads very quickly and the entire population is infected in under 100 days. The health system reaches its limits, because there are not enough intensive care units available."

But again this just delays the pandemic and we see a peak similar to the base case, but much later. The health system reaches its limits, because there are not enough intensive care units available."

The health system reaches its limits, because there are not enough intensive care units available"
